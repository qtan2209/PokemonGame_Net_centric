The primary objectives of the PokeCat and PokeBat project are:
● Practical Experience: T o provide hands-on experience in the various stages
of network application development, including design, prototyping, testing,
and evaluation.
● Protocol Utilization: T o gain proficiency in using TCP and UDP
communication protocols within a programming context.

● Theory-Practice Integration: T o strengthen understanding of networking and
communication issues by applying theoretical knowledge in a practical,
interactive setting.

The scope of this project includes the development of two main modules: PokeCat, a
text-based game focused on catching Pokémon, and PokeBat, a network-based game
centered on Pokémon battles. The project involves creating a Pokémon database
(Pokedex), managing player data, and implementing a leveling system for Pokémon.
